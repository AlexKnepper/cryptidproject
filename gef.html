        <p class="descText">Gef the Mongoose was, quite obviously, a mongoose;
					albeit one with the supposed ability of human speech. Gef was
					described as being “the size of a small rat with yellowish fur and a
					large bushy tail.” Despite this description, the creature continually
					made claims of being a terrifying spectre, which ran much contrary to
					the family’s pet-like treatment of Gef, such as taking him to the market.</p>

        <h2 class="cryptSub">History/Origin</h2>
        <div class="subBar"></div>
        <p class="histText">Gef the Mongoose, also known as the Dalby Spook, was
					claimed to be discovered by the Irving Family in Britain in the early
					1930s. They reported a persistent scratching of something small behind
					their walls, akin to a ferret, dog, or child. Not long after this
					scratching, Gef introduced itself as “a ghost in the form of a
					mongoose” born in New Dehli, India in 1852.</p>
