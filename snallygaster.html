        <p class="descText">The snallygaster is said to resemble a dragon-like
					creature, or is sometimes depicted as having features similar to a
					bird or bat, but incredibly warped. It’s main quirks are its long
					tentacles, most often depicted as coming from its beak or around its
					mouth, sharp claws and teeth, massive wings, and a large, yellow eye
					resting universally in the middle of its forehead.</p>

        <h2 class="cryptSub">History/Origin</h2>
        <div class="subBar"></div>
        <p class="histText">The snallygaster comes from stories told by German
					settlers in the early 1700s. The creature gets its name from the
					German name “schneller geist” which literally means “quick spirit”.
					The Snallygaster made a re-appearance in the 19th century, although
					many postulate that the re-emergence of the legend was circulated with
					the idea of frightening runaway slaves.</p>
