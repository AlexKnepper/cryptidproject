        <p class="descText">Indrid Cold, also known as “the smiling man”, is
					most often described as a mostly normal human man standing at a height
					of around six feet and appearing to be in his mid 30s. He is usually
					described as having a fair complexion, dark hair, and wearing a large
					coat. The most striking feature of this being, and his namesake, is
					his large, unnerving smile that seemingly never breaks.</p>

        <div class="subBar"></div>
        <p class="histText">Indrid Cold was most often and famously discovered
					in West Virginia. The first instance of his sighting was recounted by
					Woodrow Derenberger,  a salesman returning home from work, on November
					2nd, 1966. Mr. Derenberger was stopped by a “cigar shaped craft” from
					which Indrid Cold exited and spoke to him telepathically.
					Mr. Derenberger claimed to be visited many times.</p>
