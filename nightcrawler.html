        <p class="descText">An oddity alone in how recently they’ve been
					sighted, the Fresno Nightcrawlers have gained a large amount of
					interest in social media circles as well as crypid enthusiasts
					themselves. The Fresno Nightcrawler resembles a white, cloth-like
					being similar to the lower half of a human being. The size of these
					creatures seems to vary anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall.</p>

        <div class="subBar"></div>
        <p class="histText">These creatures have been spotted on multiple
					security cameras relatively recently, around Fresno, California. The
					first and most notable sighting was by a Fresno homeowner who caught
					it on security camera after being woken up by his dogs barking. Since
					then, much media has covered them, including syfy’s “Fact or Faked"
					series, who marked them as unconfirmable.</p>
